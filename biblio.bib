access control system and especially in the Internet of Things
(IoT), which can be achieved by access or authority delegation.
Delegation mechanisms in access control that have been studied
until now have been intended mainly for a system that has no
resource constraint, such as a web-based system, which is not
very suitable for a highly pervasive system such as IoT. To
this end, this paper presents an access delegation method with
security considerations based on Capability-based Context Aware
Access Control (CCAAC) model intended for federated machine-
to-machine communication or IoT networks. The main idea of
our proposed model is that the access delegation is realized by
means of a capability propagation mechanism, and incorporating
the context information as well as secure capability propagation
under federated IoT environments. By using the identity-based
capability-based access control approach as well as contextual
information and secure federated IoT, this proposed model
provides scalability and flexibility as well as secure authority
delegation for highly distributed system.},

Federated IoT : 
We want same identity cross domain. A domain is made up of several clusters managed by the same entity. 
proposes new access control model with build-in delegation : CCAAC (Capability-based Context Aware Access Control)


Anggorojati et al.~\cite{AnggorojatiMahallePrasadEtAl2012} focus on delegation
in the context of federated-IoT. They define an IoT domain as clusters of 
devices managed by the same entity. Domains can federate to allow for the 
management of a subject's identity across several of them. Being in the IoT, the
subject is a device and the interactions take the form of device-to-device
communication. For that reason, the authors use concepts and models developed 
in~\cite{prasad2010my}, such as PN.

Capabilities are used to carry permissions that are given under contextual 
conditions. Given examples of context are time, location, authentication or 
trust level. Capabilities here are descriptive and tied to the subject they 
have been created for. They are of two types: internal and external.
Internal capabilities are given to subjects that request access to an object 
belonging to the same security domain as themselves. When a subject wants to 
access an object outside of its security domain, it must obtain an external 
capability through delegation.

Let $A$, $B$ be two security domains, and $s_A$, $s_B$ subjects of $A$ and $B$
respectively. Let $O$ be an object of $A$. $s_A$ has the necessary privileges to
perform some actions on $O$. For $s_B$ to be able to access $O$, $s_A$ can 
delegate its privileges to it. To that hand, $s_A$, the delegator, sends a 
delegation request to domain $A$'s IoT Federation Manager(IoT-FM). The IoT-FM's 
role is to manage its domain participation in the federation. This include 
ruling on delegation requests. The request is checked against policies and
context. If granted, the IoT-FM of domain $A$ will produce and external 
capability for $s_B$, the delegatee, and send it back to $s_A$. Communicating 
the capability to $s_B$ is left at the charge of $s_A$.

Here, each domain's IoT-FM plays the role of a PDP. When presented with an 
access request, the end-device checks the capability that was sent along. It must
come from its domain's IoT-FM. Some local conditions might need to be checked as
well. The paper present a model and therefore stay at a really high level 
when describing the solution. No implementation has been realized.

This solution presents a high degree of usability as a subject only has to 
manage its identity in one security domain while still being able to access 
services living in others. For the same reason, it scales well in the number of
federated domains. Inside a single domain however, the PDP function is 
centralized and policies might get more complex with each new domain entering 
the federation.

Revocation is not addressed, neither explicitly nor implicitly. We can however 
suppose that capabilities have a limited lifetime. Under this assumption, the 
PDP is not needed for each access and the maintaining the system becomes easier.

As only the model is presented, it is left to the implementers to decide the 
degree of granularity. It is possible to define privileges at the resource level.},

  comment       = {The article proposes a new consensus protocol based on both PoW and PoS. They are concerned with the attack environment of cryptocurrencies after the original money supply has been distributed and the only reward for block creation comes from transaction fees.
They find that PoW miners might not have a strong enough incentive to maintain the security of the network as coins they mine might be exchanged for other currency and mining hardware can be re-purposed for other crypto-currency. Stakeholders are more invested in the system. The proposed Proof of Activity however requires more rounds of communication and more involvment.

The authors start by examining three ways in which PoW mining post minting is subject to the tragedy of the commons. The first concerns the willingness of users to pay transaction fees. Even if everybody agrees they must be paid to incentivize miners, it is in everyone best interest not to pay too high a fee themselves.The solution to this is to not include transactions with low fees in mined blocks. Which brings us to the second contradiction. It is in the miners best interest to agree on a minimum fee, that way people would have to pay or their transactions would never be included. However, miners that do not follow the rules will increase their profit as they will include more transactions in their blocks. A proposed solution is to add some protocol-enforced rules such as capping the number of transactions per block. This way, miners would only include the transactions with the highest fees which would force people to pay them. The problem is that the cost of protection might be more than the users are willing to pay. The last problem is that the fees are only paid to the miner that created the block when the cost of running the network are also in propagation, verification and storage and are shared amongs all the nodes. This could encourage miners to stop propagating the transactions to keep the reward for themselves. A solution would be to limit the allowed size of a block.
Other problems such as network DoS and isolation are considered to be out of the scope of the document as they apply to the different methods of consensus just the same.

Now for the protocol. $N$ stakeholders are chosen to sign empty PoW blocks (no transactions included). This selection is done by deriving a fixed number of satoshis from the PoW block. Then, invoking follow-the-satoshi, the life of the coin is traced from origin to the hand of its current owner. Each satoshi selects one signer. The first $N-1$ chosen ones simply sign. The $N$th one create the final block by including the PoW block, transactions, previous signatures and finally her own. The longest chain is still considered in terms of PoW. The fees are divided unequally among the miner, the signers and the final block creator. PoW is used mainly to slow down the block creation. It is a reward system rather than a punitive one. It incentivize people to run full nodes and participate actively in the network (hence the name).

Several add-ons are discussed. The first proposes to include PoW block that did not get sign to measure the stakeholder's participation level. The second wants to force the stakeholders to prove they are running a full node. Because people might not want to entrust the key they used to secure their money to an online application, a third add-on proposes key delegation. One could delegate the power of signing blocks to a key that cannot sign transactions. Actually, to discourage pooling, a trade-off is made where these keys can transfer all the funds to a pre-defined adress or transfer a limited amount to any adress. A final add-on is decentralized stake pools.},

  abstract  = {Bitcoin is a digital currency that unlike traditional currencies does not rely on a centralized authority. Instead Bitcoin relies on a network of volunteers that collectively implement a replicated ledger and verify transactions. In this paper we analyze how Bitcoin uses a multi-hop broadcast to propagate transactions and blocks throught the network to update the ledger replicas. We then use the gathered information to verify the conjecture that the propagation delay in the network is the primary cause for blockchain forks. Blockchain forks should be avoided as they are symptomatic for inconsistencies among the replicas in the network. We then show what can be achieved by pushing the current protocol to its limit with unilateral changes to the client's behavior.},
  comment   = {Network topology : The nodes form a random, ever evolving graph. Because of that, there are no detection of partitions. Tracking the computationnal power of the network could help detect such phenomenon. To join the network, a node queries a number of DNS servers and is sent adresses of nodes on the network. There are no explicit way of leaving so nodes keep a record of outdated information. Every node keep a minimum number of open connections.
Propagation : Blocks and transactions availability is broadcasted to neighbouring nodes after they have been verified. Concerned nodes can then requests it been send to them. This implies a propagation delay. It can take a really long time to reach the nodes the further away and least connected. The bigger the size of a block, the longer the delay since it needs to be verified before being passed along.
Info Elipsing : A node that receives an invalid block or transaction (maybe because of a conflict) will just ignore it. So in the event of a fork, only nodes at the cut between the two will have the information. Same goes with a double spend. This prevent a malicious node from flooding the network but makes double spend attacks invisible to almost every node. The author recognise that in the case of a transaction, this behaviour makes sense but advertise the forwarding of forking blocks. Blockchain Forks : The author shows that the slow propagation is responsible for the forking of the blockchain since a second valid block can only be found among those who do not yet know of the first one. They seem to occur at an approximate rate of 1.69% even though observing them all is next to impossible. The growing number of nodes is likely to increase the distance between the nodes and therefore the number of forks. Because of this propagation delay, the necessary computational power for an attacker to be successful is not 50% but 49.1%. Which could lower even more with the network growth. Solutions: The author proposes three unilateral changes to prevent this. Firstly, advertising the availibility of a block before verification. Secondly, advertise the availability of a block before receiving it, queuing the request fotr this block until it can be sent. Finally, th author offers to minimise the maximal distance on the network by creating hubs. These changes resulted in fork occuring half less often.},

  abstract     = {Bitcoin is the first and most popular decentralized cryptocurrency to date. In this work, we
extract and analyze the core of the Bitcoin protocol, which we term the Bitcoin backbone,
and prove two of its fundamental properties which we call common prefix and chain quality
in the static setting where the number of players remains fixed. Our proofs hinge on appropriate and
novel assumptions on the “hashing power” of the adversary relative to network synchronicity;
we show our results to be tight under high synchronization.
Next, we propose and analyze applications that can be built “on top” of the backbone pro-
tocol, specifically focusing on Byzantine agreement (BA) and on the notion of a public trans-
action ledger. Regarding BA, we observe that Nakamoto’s suggestion falls short of solving it,
and present a simple alternative which works assuming that the adversary’s hashing power is
bounded by 1/3. The public transaction ledger captures the essence of Bitcoin’s operation as
a cryptocurrency, in the sense that it guarantees the liveness and persistence of committed
transactions.  Based on this notion we describe and analyze the Bitcoin system as well as a
more elaborate BA protocol, proving them secure assuming high network synchronicity and
that the adversary’s hashing power is strictly less than 1/2, while the adversarial bound needed
for security decreases as the network desynchronizes.
Finally, we show that our analysis of the Bitcoin backbone protocol for synchronous networks
extends with relative ease to the recently considered “partially synchronous” model, where there
is an upper bound in the delay of messages that is unknown to the honest parties},

This extension and proliferation of the technology in our lives is also presenting security challenges, since the unexpected leaks of information, and illegitimate access to data and physical systems could present a high impact in our lives. This work proposes a cryptographic solution against insider threats through a distributed capability-based ac- cess control. This access control solution supports the management of certificates, authentication, and authorization processes. The capability-based approach offers benefits in terms of distributed management, support for delegation, traceability of the access, authentication chains to extend scala- bility and support of standard certificates based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). Specifically, it has been designed a capability token for CoAP Resources, which is signed with the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) in order to ensure end-to-end authentication, integrity and non-repudiation. This distributed solution allows the deployment of scenarios without the interven- tion of any intermediate entity, a distributed scenario with end-to-end access control validation has been implemented, deployed, and evaluated based on the Jennic/NXP JN5139 module. The results obtained through our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, in numbers, this has required an average of 480 ms to carry out all the validation process (included signature validation in the smart objects).},
  comment   = {In order to motivate their architectural choice, 
Hern{\'a}ndez-Ramos et al.~\cite{Hernandez-RamosJaraMarinEtAl2013} begin by 
comparing the advantages and disadvantages of different architectures in the 
context of the IoT. In light of this analysis, they opt for a distributed 
architecture based on CapBAC[CITATION NEEDED].

To access a resource, a subject must attach a valid token to its request. This 
token consists in a JSON object which fields are detailed in the article. Among
them, an issuance date along with a validity period allows for implicit 
revocation. The identity of the issuer and its signature must appear.
The subject identity is represented by its ECC-based public key. Finally, access
rights are provided along with conditions to be verified locally at access time.

The request is transmitted using CoAp~\cite{CoAp}. The actions that are available
to the subject are therefore CoAP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Resources are 
designated by a unique URI. The use of the \emph{Request-URI} field allows for 
an access that is resource-specific. The CoAp request must contain a signature
that matches the public key in the \emph{Subject} field of the token.

When receiving a request, the device acts as both a PEP, enforcing the decision 
of the token's issuer, and a PDP, checking local conditions. The order in which 
verification are performed is designed to minimize the computational burden of 
the device. Thus, the first step in validating the request is checking that the
request time falls into the token validity period. Then the requested action is 
checked against the token's access rights. Next, local conditions are evaluated.
Finally, signatures are verified, first the issuer's and then the subject's. A 
request will be rejected as soon as a check has failed. By keeping the 
computationally expensive calculations for the end, the authors minimize the
impact on the end-device.

The solution has been implemented and yields and average Round-Trip delay Time 
of 480.96 ms.

The process of issuing the token is unfortunately considered out of scope. 
Because of this, the full impact of the solution on the subject is hard to 
cannot be measured.

  abstract     = {IP technology for resource-constrained devices en-
ables transparent end-to-end connections between a vast variety
of devices and services in the Internet of Things (IoT). To protect
these connections, several variants of traditional IP security
protocols have recently been proposed for standardization, most
notably the DTLS protocol. In this paper, we identify significant
resource requirements for the DTLS handshake when employing
public-key cryptography for peer authentication and key agree-
ment purposes. These overheads particularly hamper secure com-
munication for memory-constrained devices. To alleviate these
limitations, we propose a delegation architecture that offloads the
expensive DTLS connection establishment to a delegation server.
By handing over the established security context to the con-
strained device, our delegation architecture significantly reduces
the resource requirements of DTLS-protected communication
for constrained devices. Additionally, our delegation architecture
naturally provides authorization functionality when leveraging
the central role of the delegation server in the initial connection
establishment. Hence, in this paper, we present a comprehensive,
yet compact solution for authentication, authorization, and secure
data transmission in the IP-based IoT. The evaluation results
show that compared to a public-key-based DTLS handshake our
delegation architecture reduces the memory overhead by 64 %,
computations by 97 %, network transmissions by 68 %.},
  comment      = {In this article, after studying the impact of public key cryptography on a 
constrained device using DTLS~\cite{DTLS}, Hummen and 
al.~\cite{HummenShafaghRazaEtAl2014} devise a workaround. Its purpose 
is to delegate the establishment of a DTLS connection to a delegation server 
operated by the same entity as the device. Acting on behalf of the device, the 
delegation server initiates a new DTLS connection based on public key 
cryptography with a remote end-point. With the establishment of this 
connection, the two parties establish a shared security context including a 
symmetric session key. The delegation server then hands this security context 
encrypted with a device-specific master-key over to the device. The latter will 
only accept connection involving this key. That way, the delegation server 
controls who can communicate with the device. The device maintains a revocation list.

In this scheme, the device or rather the delegation server needs to be the one 
initiating the connection with the remote end-point. The advantage is that the 
scheme only uses mechanisms of DTLS. The role of the delegation server might 
not even be known to the remote end-point.

This  paper  mainly  analyzes  existing  authentication  and  access  
control  methods,  and  then,  it  designs  a  feasible  one  for  the  
Internet of Things.},
  comment      = {Liu et al.~\cite{LiuXiaoChen2012} present a solution that focuses on the 
efficient establishment of session keys. They are therefore more interested in
identification and authentication.
 
Their architecture involves a Registration Authority (RA). It is mandatory for 
every device to be registered with one of these RA. The RA, that can be regarded
as a gateway, maintains a history record of all access requests for audit 
purposes. It uses elliptic curve cryptography to establish a session key between
device and users. The identification of users is inspired by 
OpenID~\cite{OpenID} and done through federated identity management.

When making an access request, the user is redirected to 
the RA. The RA then contacts the user's identity provider (called Home 
Registration Authority or HRA) who challenges the user to confirm its identity. 
On positive identification, the RA, in accordance with its policies, 
establishes a session key for the exchange. The policies on the RA are defined 
using RBAC~\cite{FerraioloKuhn2009}.

Here, the device has no access control function of its own, other than being 
able to resume a session, which can be considered as enforcement of a decision
taken by the PDP(RA), namely provisioning the session key. This makes the device
a PEP. Registration with the nearby 
RA is long term and the access request concern a device-level access. 
Registration with multiple RA is not mentioned. 

Because the subject might be another device and its HRA play the same role as 
the object's RA, this solution fits into collaborative architectures. Several 
domains co-exist. Subjects can try and request access to objects that lay in
other domains. Their original domain must then provide a PIP where claims can
be verified.

The heavy computations required to establish session keys are handled by the RA.
Because sessions are used, the cost of establishing a secure connection is only
paid once per session. Using federated authentication allow this solution to
scale well. The history maintained by the RA can be used for security audits.

However, as we can see in Figure~\ref{Liu}, the solution requires a lot of extra
messages. It also requires the user to be able to answer a request, as the RA 
will demand information on its HRA (step 3) and its HRA will challenge it to 
confirm its identity (step 5.1).

The storage for the access control rules is
not explicitly given but we can assume it is stored with the RA. Since the RA is
only involved with the establishment of the session key, updates to the access 
control policies will be taken into account when a new session is created. 

Because the keys are generated by the RA, and a history of the access request 
maintained by the RA, the users have to trust it.},

  abstract  = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash- based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof- of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},
  comment   = {Trust is needed in our current system to avoid reversal of a transaction. Bitcoin eliminates this by relaying not on people but on cryptography. The proposed system is secure as long as honest nodes constitute more than 50\% of the computational power of the network. A coin is defined as a chain of digital signature. Transfer happens by signing a hash of both the previous transaction and the public key of the new owner with the private key of the current one. This creates a verifiable chain of ownership. Transactions can combine multiple inputs and have at most two output : payment and change if any. To avoid double spending, nodes need to agree on a timeline. This is done through the blockchain. Transactions are grouped into blocks. A block is then coupled with a nounce such that hashing the two together will result in a value starting with a number of 0s. Each block contains a link to the previous one. The block and its hash is then spread across the network. Changing the block means finding another valid hash. It also implies redoing all the blocks that came after it. The longest chain represents the majority decision as the most work went into it. Honnest nodes will therefore always work on the longest chain. The difficulty is modulated over time depending on the average time taken to make a block. In the event of a fork, nodes will work on the first block they received. The next block will break ties and decide which chain is the longest. When a node creates a valid block, the first transaction it contains is a new coin granted to itself. This acts as an incentive but also puts coins into circulation without the need for a central authority. Once a predetermined number of coin has entered circulation, the insentive will be transaction fees. Transactions are hashed into a Merkle tree, the root of which is included into the blocks' hash. This allow nodes to discard old transactions without disrupting the chain. To verify a payment, a user can simply request the longest blockchain and associated Merkle trees from network nodes and check that its transaction has been accepted by the network. For the sake of privacy, public keys are kept anonymous. The steps are the following : 1. New transactions are broadcasted to all nodes 2. Each node collects new transactions into a block 3. Each node works on finding a proof-of-work for its block 4. When one is found, the node broadcasts its block to all nodes 5. Nodes accept the block if the transactions it contains are valid 6. Nodes start working on the next block using the new block's hash.},

constrained back-end servers while keeping message exchanges

  comment      = {This paper adresses authorization and access control in the IoT, putting an accent on the constrained component of the devices. They take the case of devices communicating with several nodes and therefore having to enforce some kind of fine grained authorization decisions. This approach is focused on using local parameters, being a generic solution and using standards optimized for constrained environmenent (no additionnal message + reasonable run-time).

The framework presents several requirements. Among them granularity, local parameters used in the decision process, different access rules for different clients, impact no the device must be minimal, the access control must depend on a minimum of other functions and finally, it must provide end-to-end security as well as replay protection.The framework described here is independent of authentification mechanisms, key management or secure transport protocol. In addition to these, it complies to the requirement described by Naetale's paper.

XACML policy evaluation is too heavy a computation, therefore, the solution focuses on the device as an enforcement endpoint rather than a decision one. The local conditions are evaluated on the device to avoid extra messages and delays. Decisons are carried from the external decisions point to the device using assertions and the SAML standard. OAuth was also considered. The framework is comprised of Three entities : a User, a Device and an Authorization Engine. The device owner configures the access policies on the AE which delivers assertions to Users according to these policies. The Users then present the assertions along with its request. A Forth actor, the Resource Directory, facilitate resource discovery.

The underlying protocol is CoAp used with DTLS.

When delivering the assertions, the AE may also give the session key to encrypt messages. To prevent replay attacks, the assertions can only be used for a short time after issuance. The device may also store recently used assertions. The implementation uses JWE for assertions



Seitz et al.~\cite{SeitzSelanderGehrmann2013} present a generic authorization
framework with the following features: fine-grained, decision based on local
parameters, no extra messages from the end-device, and a reasonable execution time.

The decision logic is expressed using XACML~\cite{XACML}. XACML policy 
evaluation is too heavy a computation, therefore, the solution focuses on the 
device as an enforcement endpoint (PEP) rather than a decision one (PDP). The 
local conditions are evaluated on the device to avoid extra messages and 
delays. Decisions are carried from the PDP to the device using assertions and 
the SAML standard~\cite{SAML}. OAuth 2.0~\cite{OAuth2} was also considered.

As shown on Figure~\ref{seitz}, the framework is comprised of three entities: a
User, a Device and an Authorization Engine (AE). The device owner configures the
access policies on the AE which delivers assertions to Users according to these 
policies. The User then present the assertions along with its request. A Forth 
actor, the Resource Directory, facilitate resource discovery. 

The underlying protocol is CoAp~\cite{CoAp} used 
with DTLS~\cite{DTLS}. When delivering the assertions, the AE may also give the 
session key to encrypt messages. To prevent replay attacks, the assertions can 
only be used for a short time after issuance. The device may also store 
recently 
used assertions. The implementation uses JWE~\cite{JWE} for assertions.

The discovery system allows the User to request its assertion from the AE without
first referring to the Device. The assertion is sent with the request for 
evaluation. This means no extra messages are needed. The requests concern 
resources on the device rather than the Device itself, meaning the solution is 
fine-grained. 

The token containing the assertion is single use. A new one must be requested 
for each new interaction, this doubles the number of messages required of the 
Subject. In addition, the assertions have a short lifespan and should be 
requested right before access. 

This short life means that, once pushed to the AE, permission update take effect
with only a small delay. The solution is replay-proof and requires both ends to 
mutual authenticate.

This solution is used as a frame of reference by Cherkaoui et 
al.~\cite{cherkaoui:ujm-01011300}. This second article focuses on the physical 
aspect of the IoT. It presents Physical Uncloneable Functions (PUF)
[CITATION NEEDED] as a mean to generate and protect the keys used to secure communication.
PUF uses the unique physical characteristics of a device to produce a secret key
that is unique, random, reliable and tamper resistant. PUF are also a low cost
solution.

The authors then discuss the use of embedded SIM (eSIM). Because an IoT device 
can outlast the lifetime of the SIM card that it uses for communication, the 
problem of replacing this card or provisioning it with information from a new 
provider arises. eSIM are introduced as a way to circumvent this issue.

This second article brings a solution to issues such as key provisioning or 
resistance to physical tampering that appeared as requirements 
in~\cite{SeitzSelanderGehrmann2013} but were not resolved.},

  abstract = {The new generation of Wireless Sensor Networks, that is known as the
Internet of Things enables the direct connection of physical objects to the
Internet using microcontrollers. In most cases these microcontrollers have
very limited computational resources. The global connectivity provides great
opportunities for data collection and analysis as well as for interaction of
objects that cannot be connected to the same local area network. Many of
application scenarios have high requirements to security and privacy of
transmitted data. At the same time security solutions that are utilized for
general purpose computers are not always applicable for constrained devices.
That leaves a room for new solutions that takes into account the technological
aspects of the Internet of Things.
In this thesis we investigate the access control solution for the IETF standard
draft Constrained Application Protocol, using the Datagram Transport Layer
Security protocol for transport security. We use the centralized approach to
save access control information in the framework. Since the public key
cryptography operations might be computationally too expensive for
constrained devices we build our solution based on symmetric cryptography.
Evaluation results show that the access control framework increases
computational effort of the handshake by 6.0%, increases the code footprint of
the Datagram Transport Layer Security implementation by 7.9% and has no
effect on the overall handshake time. Our novel protocol is not vulnerable to
Denial of Service or Drain Battery Attack.},

Vitalik explains Bitcoin mining. He explains what a 51% attacker can and connot do. Namely only accepts its own block (increasing it's reward), refusing to include transactions (censoring) and reversing transactions. It cannot however steal or create coins.

Pools are then explained : 
Participant mine in the pools name (ie reward goes to the pool adress). They receive a small reward for block that are almost valid (called share) which increases expected profit for them. Specialized hardware being too specialized, they are not good at things that are not mining. Pool participant therefore rely on the pool to provide them with the mining data, including previous block, Merkle tree root and others.

It then goes into the main arguments people use to dismiss the possibility of a pool going rogue. Among them the auto regulation of participant, the absence of incentives and so on. Yet, some pools have been know to reverse transactions (for moral reason for exemple [payment for child pornography]). And one cannot assume participants will always act in the interest of the community, especially as Bitcoin gets professionalized.

Solutions
Sabotage : Mine from inside the pool but do not forward winning blocks. Pb : People can do the same to every pool et ça s'annule.
P2P mining pool : they implement a smaller faster blockchain among themselves to mine. Pb : Requires a full-node which people don't want
Mining algo that forces a full node
Make mining non-outsourcable : using Zero knwoledge proof, let people claim the reward for themselves even when they mine from inside a pool PB : complexity + lots of changes + no pools may mean professionnalized mining with a few players.
Change pooling algos : now participants are paid depending on the revenue. So being in a bigger pool means bigger reward. Pb : risk is for the pool so no one willing to do that
Mining for several pools simutaneously (and splitting the rewards mong them)

The last part puts ASICs use and fabrication in perpective.},

Simulated mining rig : every account has a chance proportionnal to its balance of generating a valid block

Advantages : Not energy wasteful, arguably more secure (you need 51% of the currency), faster block generation
Problem : Nothing at stake (it's in one best interest to participate in several chains)
In PoS, the computing power is verified in itself by the production of the hash whereas in PoS each chain is only aware of itself. Makes the system less stable

Other version of PoS : signers are known in advance and reward is locked for a certain amount of blocks
How do we select signers ? If they are know in advance, they can manipulate the data to have more chances to be chosen again quickly. Shlasher solves this by implementing a decentralized random number generator. In two rounds. First round participant submit hashes of their value. Second round submit value

To mitigate this, mandatory garanty deposits punish the ones voting for several fork (Slasher 1.0)

tations on data while keeping the data completely private. Enigma’s computational
model is based on a highly optimized version of secure multi-party computation,
guaranteed by a verifiable secret-sharing scheme.   For storage,  we use a modi-
fied distributed hashtable for holding secret-shared data.  An external blockchain
is utilized as the controller of the network, manages access control, identities and
serves as a tamper-proof log of events. Security deposits and fees incentivize oper-
ation, correctness and fairness of the system. Similar to Bitcoin, Enigma removes
the need for a trusted third party, enabling autonomous control of personal data.
For the first time, users are able to share their data with cryptographic guarantees
regarding their privacy.},
  comment   = {Privacy : uses secure multi-party computation so no access to data, only fragments
Scalability : unlike BC, each node does not have a replica of the data, only a small set is involved in each calculation. So reduced redundancy.

Enigma offload heavy computations to an off BC network. It uses private contracts instead of public smart contracts. The scripting language is Turing complete. On BC, code is decentralized but not distributed. Enigma has a distributed hash-table accessible through the BC for storage purposes. It can also run heavy computations and then publish proof of correctness on the BC. state of the art MPC can guarantee correctness with dishonest majority (SPDZ). The shares of the SPDZ protocol are published on the BC. This guarantees accountability and correctness. To optimize the network usage, a set of nodes is selected at "random", taking into account reputation and load-balancing. To avoid collusion, the computation can be subdivised into simpler components. Each component is computed by a different set, the intermediary results becoming the inputs for each subsequent set of nodes. 

Data are stored and accessed in 3 distinct ways. Through the BC, where everything is public and all nodes have the same state. Through the DHT where data should be encrypted locally before storage and access can be restricted using a predicate. Using MPC.

A big chunk of the article is dedicated to showing results in the field of MPC communications

Incentive : Nodes are compensated by fees for providing a service. Upon registration, full nodes must make a security deposit. If they miss behave, their deposit is split amonst honest nodes and the computation continues without them. Computation fees are divided amongst node that participated in the computation based on their participation (rounds of computation they performed). The fee cannot always be calculated in advance (because Turing complete. A certain threshhold is needed for the computation to go through. Nodes also take fees for storage. These are market based and time limited. The fees are paid using contract. When a contract expires, it is renewed unless the account balance of the requesting party is too low. In which case, (s)he has a limited time to pay, after which the data are deleted.},

Solution : The system comprises three entities : the users, the party providing the applications and the nodes that maintain the blockchain. It accepts two kinds of transactions T_{access} for access control management, and T_{data} for data storage and retrieval. A shared (compound) identity is created for each user/service pair. The user is the owner of this identity, the service is a guest and has limited access to it. It is comprised of a shared private encryption key and a pair of public/private signing key for each. The identity, or rather the public signing keys, is then sent to the blockchain with its associated permissions via a T_{access} transaction. Data are encrypted using the shared encryption key and send to the blockchain using a T_{data} transaction. Upon reception, the data are stored in a off-blockchain hashtable, the public ledger only retaining a hash of it. User and service can request the data via a T_{data} transaction containing the pointer (its hash) to the data. The blockchain verifies the signature and the access rights for each request. The user can change the permissions by issuing a new T_{access} transaction. Sending an empty set of permission will revoked all access rights. The privacy and security of the system relies on the user informed management of their keys. This doesn't prevent a node from tampering with the data. But sufficient replication and distribution should ensure that if enough nodes are consulted, the integrity should be assured. The author proposes a reputation system as an alternative for the proof of work. Not adressed : Nature of incentives to maintain the blockchain.},

cryptocurrencies,  Bitcoin  and  Ethereum,  support  the  fea-

of smart contracts, or full-fledged programs that are run on
blockchains.   Recently,  Ethereum’s  smart  contract  system
has seen steady adoption,  supporting tens of thousands of
contracts, holding millions dollars worth of virtual coins.
In this paper, we investigate the security of running smart
contracts based on Ethereum in an open distributed network
like those of cryptocurrencies.  We introduce several new se-

gaps in the understanding of the distributed semantics of the
underlying platform.  As a refinement, we propose ways to
enhance the operational semantics of Ethereum to make con-
tracts less vulnerable.  For developers writing contracts for

whether or not to embrace the idea of an open platform and open-source software, but to establish a methodology
to verify the trustworthiness and control any access. This paper focuses on building an access control model and
system based on trust computing. This is a new field of access control techniques which includes Access Control,
Trust Computing, Internet of Things, network attacks, and cheating technologies. Nevertheless, the target access
control systems can be very complex to manage. This paper presents an overview of the existing work on trust

There is a lot of hype around the internet of things (IoT) and it continues to evolve as we move beyond humans talking to machines.

Complicated network produces potential vulnerabilities referred to heterogeneous devices, sensors and backend systems. So to realize the dream of internet of things secured device to device communication is expected. Security of resource constrained networks becomes prime important. Many existing mechanisms gives security and protection to networks and systems but they are unable to give fine grain access control. In this work, we focused on CoAP based framework to give service level access control on resource constrained devices. It gives fine grain access control on a per service basis. ECDSA is used to improve privacy of the system. Performance of CoAP based framework is compared and analyzed with existing security solutions. Test results are presented which shows that communication overhead and authentication delay are less than the existing system. Hence security performance of system gets improved. The goal is to present comprehensive security framework for low power networks consist of resource constrained devices.},

in the literature as a new paradigm for IoT where
remotely controlled smart objects can act on their
own to sense/actuate, store, and interpret information
either created by them or within the surrounding
environment. This paradigm calls for novel
security and access control mechanisms to enable
smart objects with various resource limitations to
evaluate a claimed access right from external entities
without relying on central authorization systems.
This article proposes utilizing a community-based
structure to define the notion of access rights in
a distributed IoT environment. With this structure,
within a given community of smart objects sharing a
common mission, access rights are to be evaluated
based on the community norms by smart objects
with sufficient resources on behalf of those with
resource limitations. A novel, community-driven,
access control framework is proposed in addition to
a prototype to demonstrate access control granting
in a user-friendly manner.},
  comment   = {IoT divided in commmunities.
Within each community, several roles are dealt out : 
 - Gatekeepers (PEP)
 - CAs (PIP)
 - AS (PDP)

Devices might not have any access control logic.

CA validates subjects attributes
AS delivers token based on these validated attributes
Gatekeeper validate token validity

Paper contains a detailed description of the community token + token issuance
Token (JSON format) contains : 
 - Subject, 
 - Target device (can be further specified but hints at low granularity), 
 - community this device belongs to (in that instance), 
 - validity span, 
 - actions (CoAp actions : read, create, modify or delete), 
 - local conditions

Moving from an identity-centric to an attribute centric approach.


In their paper, Hussein et al.~\cite{hussein2017community} introduce COCapBAC, 
for COmmunity-driven Capability-Based Access Control.
They postulate that an IoT device is rarely isolated and rather shares
a common goal with other IoT devices. Such a group forms a community. That 
community is likely composed of heterogeneous device with different capacities.
Within the community, the following roles are therefore distributed accordingly:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{CA}(Certificate Authority) in charge of certifying attributes (PIP)
	\item \emph{AS}(Authorization Server) in charge of issuing capabilities (PDP)
	\item \emph{Gatekeepers} in charge of validating capabilities (PEP)
\end{itemize}

The authors strongly feel that the IoT should move from identity-centric to 
attribute-centric systems. In their scheme, a \emph{subject} first goal is therefore
to contact a \emph{CA} trusted by the \emph{AS} that will be able to certify their 
attributes. Because these certified attributes will be the bases for access 
control decisions, the \emph{CA} plays here the role of the PIP.

Once they are in possession of certified attributes, they send them to the 
\emph{Gatekeeper} along with an access request. The \emph{Gatekeeper} will 
forward those information to the \emph{AS} that will decide whether to issue a 
capability for the \emph{subject}. In any case, the decision and the eventual capability
is returned to the \emph{subject} through the \emph{Gatekeeper}.

That capability token contains information on the privileges granted to the subject.
The granularity of the permission can be adjusted. The token carries an issuance 
time, and a validity period. Local conditions can also be specified that should 
be checked by the \emph{Gatekeeper} at access time.

When accessing an object, it is not clear whether the \emph{subject} should direct its 
request to the \emph{Gatekeeper} or to the device that holds the object. In the 
latter case, the device will forward the request to the \emph{Gatekeeper}. 
That request should include a valid capability. In the case where local 
conditions should be checked, the \emph{Gatekeeper} will act as both the PDP and
PEP.

The solution has been implemented by the authors. If the format of the token and
its issuance have been described in details, the process of forming the community,
role attribution, attributes verification, delegation mechanisms or policy 
definitions are not discussed.

Revocation of granted privileges can be achieved implicitly by setting an 
expiration time in the token or explicitly by pushing revocation policies to 
the \emph{Gatekeeper}.},

3 types of transaction : 


Does not define how the resource address is retrieved or how the owner is linked to a resource

Zyskind et al.~\cite{ZyskindNathanPentland2015} were the first to use the 
blockchain for access control purposes. Their paper was aimed at ensuring the 
privacy of a mobile user's data. Encrypted data was stored off-blockchain 
whereas the access rules were published to the blockchain. Applications wishing 
to access the data then had to publish a request to the blockchain, leaving a 
visible trace of every access request they made. This solution however is 
terribly unscalable as a different key is required for each user-application pair.

Ouaddah et al.'s propose a blockchain-based access control framework that focuses on the IoT. 
A subject wishing to access a device should first contact the device owner. She 
will then publish to the blockchain the conditions under which access is to be 
granted to this subject along with an access token encrypted with the subject's 
public key. This transaction is propagated to all the nodes in the network that 
check its validity.

To get access to the device, the subject will then need to produce a valid 
transaction redeeming the previous one. For the transaction to be valid, the 
subject must be able to prove it complies with the policy described by the owner.
Each validating node will therefore act as a PDP. The transaction being deemed 
valid and integrated to the blockchain means that a majority of PDP agrees access
should be granted. Because it has been published to the blockchain, the access
request is now on record.

Finally, the subject presents the deciphered token to the IoT device that 
verifies its integrity and checks that the corresponding transaction has been published
to the blockchain.

This solution has not been implemented yet. But the paper proposes to use a 
blockchain similar to that of Bitcoin~\cite{nakamoto2008} but dedicated to this 
application. 
The paper also describes a delegation scheme as well as a revocation mechanism.

Summary :

In their paper~\cite{barka2015securing}, Barka et al. propose to adapt 
RBAC~\cite{FerraioloKuhn2009} to the Web of Things(WoT). They divide it into
a hierarchy of Ambient Spaces, each representing the boundaries of a physical 
space such as rooms, buildings, neighborhoods, cities, etc. Each one of these 
spaces has a manager to handle the devices and possible embedded Ambient Spaces 
it contains. The Ambient Space Manager (ASM) is the entry point into its space. 
It encompasses both the function of PEP and PDP, even if they might be 
implemented in different modules. Because all devices live in an Ambient Space, 
they all defer to an ASM. The devices are not accessed directly but through 
their ASM. They do not seem to possess access control logic of their own.

Authors recognize that RBAC is subject to role proliferation and mitigate this 
risk with role parametrization[ADD REF HERE]. Because the definition of roles is
often a static process, we argue that this is not enough to make RBAC usable for
the IoT.

The alternate technique for expressing policies is by enu-

adopts the enumerated style for expressing authorization

these two attributes. Thus, LaBAC can be considered as
a bare minimum ABAC model. We show equivalence of
LaBAC and 2-sorted-RBAC with respect to theoretical ex-

  comment   = {Cerf~\cite{cerf2015access} is of the opinion that it is vital to move the access
control logic to the edge of network, as close as possible to the end-device. A
few hypothesis are made on theit abilities: they have the ability to generate 
their own keys, execute cryptographic operation, symmetric or asymmetric, and 
can resist physical tampering.

The use of unforgeable capabilities is suggested to materialize the bound 
between the device and its controller, which is unique, produced by the device
itself. If the controller is not assumed to change IP over time, it should still
be possible to associate it with a unique identifier such as a domain name. 

When the end-device is configured, a way of communicating with its controller 
should be provided. The device then produces a capability consisting in a nounce
encrypted with the controller's public key and signed with the device's private
key. When communicating, the nounce must be returned encrypted with the device's
public key and signed with the controller's private key. It is single use.

It is interesting to note that here the end-device is both a PDP and a PEP but 
not simultaneously. The device must indeed decipher and check the validity of 
the nounce previously generated by itself. The capability falls into opaque 
capabilities where no information on the privileges contained within can be 
gathered from the capability itself.

Another interesting fact is that Cerf consider the device to be linked to a 
unique controller. This departs from the postulate that in the IoT, the list of
subject wishing to access a given object is dynamic, which is often the basis
of access control solutions.},

  comment      = {Ashibani et al.'s solution~\cite{ashibani2017context} focuses on authentication.
Classical authentication mechanisms are augmented by contextual information 
gathered on the user. Confidence levels are assigned by a central administrator 
to all available authentication factors. Such factors can be a user's profile, 
its location or historical information. Access is then dependent on the 
confidence level reached by the user's authentication.

If the owner of a smart home considers being actually inside the house is a 
mandatory condition to be able to interact with its devices, then the location 
parameter will be given a high confidence level. If he'd rather not be disturbed
during the night, time will be given more importance.

The paper describes the registration of a user, the validation of this new user's 
participation by the administrator, the completion of its profile over time with
new information such as the device used for logging in or an access pattern. 
The access level of a user is continuously re-calculated based on available 
information.

Every access request must go through a gateway. That gateway is in charge of 
computing every user's access level and grants access based on policies defined 
by the administrator. The devices themselves have no access control logic of 
their own.

This highly centralized approach is a huge hindrance to the scalability of this
solution, as every single access request must go through a single gateway. 
Another issue is the need for the administrator to validate every new user's 
participation. 
However, in the context of a smart home, the number of users and therefore the 
number of simultaneous requests is relatively small.

On the other hand, the system is highly usable. Most of the contextual 
information are gathered without the user's intervention, so the added layer of
security does not affect the user's experience.

Revocation is implicit with the expiration of authentication. Access attempts are
logged encrypted to build the user's profile. No delegation mechanism is described.},

(IoT) and the usage of low-powered devices (sensors and
effectors), a large number of people are using IoT systems in
their homes and businesses to have more control over their
technology. However, a key challenge of IoT systems is data
protection in case the IoT device is lost, stolen, or used by one of
the owner’s friends or family members. The problem studied
here is how to protect the access to data of an IoT system. To
solve the problem, an attribute-based access control (ABAC)
mechanism is applied to give the system the ability to apply
policies to detect any unauthorized entry. Finally, a prototype
was built to test the proposed solution. The evaluation plan was
applied on the proposed solution to test the performance of the
system.},
  comment      = {Hemdi et Deters~\cite{hemdi2016using} consider the main challenges in designing
a secure IoT solution to be the security of information and the irresponsibility 
of users. The latter prompted them to advocate for a solution based on attributes
rather than identity. By combining attributes such as username, password, MAC
address, access time and possibly others, the likelihood of somebody assuming
the identity of an authorized user is considerably lowered. The emphasis here is
put on context.

Their solution is mainly presented through its implementation. The subject is a
web application that uses CoAP to push its requests, in a JSON format. The 
request is sent to a server running on a Rapsberry Pi 2 that exposes a 
RESTful service. Parsed attributes are then compared with data stored in an 
MySQL database. All requests, successfull or otherwise, are logged in the 
database. If the request is valid, the server responds with a \emph{Hello
World} message.

The only actors here are the subject and the device. The latter then acts as 
both the PEP and PDP. Special care as been taken to lower the computational 
burden on the device. The authors have evaluated their solution by firing a
number of requests (25, 50 and 100) in a short period of time (125 ms, 250 ms 
and 500 ms), this using 5 to 15 users.

Here the access control logic is left entirely in the hands of the end-device. 
Enrollment of new users and their devices (MAC address) is not addressed, neither
is the provisioning of permissions or their granularity. Revocation of 
attributed permissions or deletion of users is not discussed. Support for 
delegation is not mentioned.

Because the access control decision is taken on the device itself, there is a 
potential for a high level of context-awareness, at least on the side of the 
end-device. However, the example implementation does not embrace this potential.
The device does keep track of access attempts. But because of its limited 
storage capacities, a big number of failed attempts might fill its memory and 
hinder its ability to function normally. 

Finally, because the end-device itself needs to be configured to accept new 
clients, the solution would not scale. Maintenance might require the end-device
to be made inaccessible which would interrupt the service. Users would need to 
not only register with every end-device but also to register every new device 
used to access the service with every one of them, making for poor usability.},

  comment      = {Bandara et al.~\cite{bandara2016access} propose a solution that has been tested 
in a real situation: a
smart-building with over 300 devices. They present a centralized system were
the functions of authentication and authorization have been split between two
distinct entities, leading to an unusual use of tokens.

The first step in their security workflow is the user's authentication. To
authenticate itself, the user must send its credential to the Authentication
Manager (PIP). Optionally, the user may also send a preferred method of
authentication and a strength. The latter refers to the lowest level of trust
desired by the user. Each authentication method corresponds to a trust level.
Some of the devices can only be accessed by user's that have been strongly
authenticated, using a code sent to the user's registered phone number rather
than with a simple password for instance. This provides another layer of
protection to the building's most sensitive functionalities such as setting the
general temperature.

A successful authentication is materialized by a token signed by the
Authentication Manager. This token contains the user identifier, the method
used for its authentication and its corresponding trust level, the token's
duration, and a field called permission that, in the implementation,
corresponds to a role.

After obtaining its authentication token, the user is then able to request
access to an object by sending a request to the corresponding device (PEP). If
the user has provided a token and if this token is not expired, the device
passes the user's request along to the Access Control Manager (PDP). After
checking the validity of the authentication token's signature, the PDP evaluates
the request using a decision engine based on XACML and the information
contained within the token as authorization decision factor. Finally, the
decision is communicated to the device for enforcement.

The evaluation of the implementation yields the following conclusion: With 50
users or less, the average response time is less than 0.1 seconds, which
satisfies the first Nielsen limitation[CITATION NEEDED].

By splitting the function of authentication and authorization, Bandara et al.'s
solution takes a step towards a more scalable system. But by their own
admission, the solution might profit from a decentralized PDP, especially
because it is called with every access request. The system is however fairly
maintainable as adding and deleting policies from the policy repository can be
done without affecting its functioning.

The authors mention the possibility of storing logs and using cache in the
devices with enough power to allow it.},

  abstract  = {A hierarchical key assignment scheme is a method
to assign some private information and encryption keys to a set
of classes in a partially ordered hierarchy, in such a way that
the private information of a higher class can be used to derive
the keys of all classes lower down in the hierarchy. Sometimes,
it is necessary to make dynamic updates to the hierarchy,
in order to implement an access control policy which evolves
with time. All security models for hierarchical key assignment
schemes have been designed to cope with static hierarchies and
do not consider the issue of performing dynamic updates to the
hierarchy. In this paper, we define the concept of hierarchical key
assignment schemes supporting dynamic updates, formalizing the
relative security model. In particular, we provide the notion of
security with respect to key indistinguishability, by considering
the dynamic changes to the hierarchy. Moreover, we show how
to construct a hierarchical key assignment scheme supporting
dynamic updates, by using as a building block a symmetric
encryption scheme. The proposed construction is provably secure
with respect to key indistinguishability, and provides efficient key
derivation and updating procedures, while requiring each user
to store only a single private key.},
  comment   = {Methods to dynamically update a hierarchie of keys
key indistinguishability

Classical hierarchical key assignment schemes are static. Aim of paper is devising dynamically updatable scheme to support changes in access control decisions.
TA = Trust Anchor, assigns keys 

2 notions of formal security :
 - key recovery : an adversary should not be able to calculate a key it should not know
 - key indistinguishability : an adversary should not be able to distinguish a key from a rdm string

But hierarchie is considered static during the attack. Need to extend the attacker model

Contribution : new security model  + construction of a hierarchical sheme with updates (user only needs to store one key !)

Update operations :
Insertion of an edge
Insertion of a class
Deletion of an edge
Deletion of a class
Key replacement
User revocation

2 models of challenge : pre-detrmined sequence vs adaptively chosen sequence
2 models of adversary : static (access to sequence of event + public information) vs adaptive (can be assumed to have corrupted a number of classes)
adversary is given either a rdm string or a key. Must distinguish},

  abstract  = {Internet of Things (IoT) represents a fundamental infrastructure and set of techniques that support innovative services in various application domains. Trust management plays an important role in enabling the reliable data collection and mining, context-awareness, and enhanced user security in the IoT. The main tasks of trust management include trust architecture design and reputation evaluation. However, existing trust architectures and reputation evaluation solutions cannot be directly applied to the IoT, due to the large number of physical entities, the limited computation ability of physical entities, and the highly dynamic nature of the network. In comparison, it generally requires a general and flexible architecture to manage trust in such a dynamic environment as IoT. In this paper, we present IoTrust, a trust architecture that integrates Soft Defined Network (SDN) in IoT, and a cross-layer authorization protocol based on IoTrust. IoTrust and the protocol together provide a new insight for research on trust management in the IoT. For trust establishment, we further propose a Behavior-based Reputation Evaluation Scheme for the Node (BES) and an Organization Reputation Evaluation Scheme (ORES). Both our theoretical analysis and simulation results validate the efficiency of BES and ORES.},

  year      = {2018},
  abstract  = {With the inclusion of mobile devices and ubiquitous connectivity of smart devices in Internet
of Things (IoT), secure key management is mandatory to ensure privacy for information exchange. In this
regard, the multiparty key establishment schemes achieve better security strength by taking shared
parameters from neighboring member nodes to calculate the key. The similar multiparty mechanism can be
adopted among other hierarchical nodes including head node, server and gateway node. Moreover, session
keys can also be set up in a similar manner. The main problem in multiparty password-based authentication
schemes is the computation of extensively hard problem that limits it to three parties and N-party is quite
more complex or infeasible. This paper presents a novel Distributed Multiparty Keying (DMK) scheme
where chaotic maps are used to provide one-way hashing and Chebyshev polynomial (CP) are used for
establishing a common multiparty key. In our work, Phase-I covers keying among trusted server and group
heads and Phase-II elaborates the key establishment among smart devices and their group heads. The scheme
is verified through the formal specification and security analysis using Rubin Logic for inter-group key
establishment scenario. We have validated the intra-group and inter-group key establishment by doing
extensive simulations in NS 2.35. Moreover, a testbed is setup for GH to server level authentication and key
establishment. Results prove the supremacy of our scheme as compared to preliminaries in terms of
computation cost, communication cost and resilience.},

internet connectivity to reach not just computers and
humans, but most of our environment things. The IoT has
the potential to connect billions of objects simultaneously
which has the impact of improving information sharing
needs that result in improving our life. Although the IoT
benefits are unlimited, there are many challenges facing
adopting the IoT in the real world due to its centralized
server/client model. For instance, scalability and security
issues that arise due to the excessive numbers of IoT
objects in the network. The server/client model requires
all devices to be connected and authenticated through the
server, which creates a single point of failure. Therefore,
moving the IoT system into the decentralized path may be
the right decision. One of the popular decentralization
systems is blockchain. The Blockchain is a powerful
technology that decentralizes computation and
management processes which can solve many of IoT
issues, especially security. This paper provides an
overview of the integration of the blockchain with the IoT
with highlighting the integration benefits and challenges.

Digital safety concerns include what is being recorded and who is monitoring them. IoT devices, like the Fisher Price Smart Toys are designed to play with children of ages 3-8 and entertain them with various activities. This has expanded digital exposure into children's spaces. These toys contain a variety of communication technologies that users are ill-prepared to understand, a myriad of sensors collecting private data, including video, and often rely on inadequate security tools and methodology. This intersection of poor security, invasive sensor data, and proximity to children may put children at risks both online and in-person. In examining the Fisher Price Bear, our researchers were able to both verify that security tools have been implemented to fix network security failures previously found in the toy, but also discovered a security flaw which allows root access to the smart toy, allowing full access to the nose camera and other sensors. Preliminary results are presented in how the operating system can be modified in order to install software so that a modified bear can be controlled remotely. Mitigation education is presented as a critical instrument for self-protection of parents and children in a smart toy environment.},

this scheme also enables one to efficiently compute a nonmembership witness

accumulators and prove its security based on the strong RSA assumption. We further
present a construction for dynamic universal accumulators; this construction
allows one to dynamically add and delete inputs with constant computational
cost. Our construction directly builds upon Camenisch and Lysyanskaya’s dynamic
accumulator scheme. Universal accumulators can be seen as an extension
to dynamic accumulators with support of nonmembership witness. We also give
an efficient zero-knowledge proof protocol for proving that a committed value is
not in the accumulator. Our dynamic universal accumulator construction enables
efficient membership revocation in an anonymous fashion.},

smart contract-based framework, which consists of multiple access control contracts (ACCs), one judge contract (JC) and
one register contract (RC), to achieve distributed and trustworthy access control for IoT systems. Each ACC provides one access
control method for a subject-object pair, and implements both static access right validation based on predefined policies and
dynamic access right validation by checking the behavior of the subject. The JC implements a misbehavior-judging method
to facilitate the dynamic validation of the ACCs by receiving misbehavior reports from the ACCs, judging the misbehavior
and returning the corresponding penalty. The RC registers the information of the access control and misbehavior-judging
methods as well as their smart contracts, and also provides functions (e.g., register, update and delete) to manage these
methods. To demonstrate the application of the framework, we provide a case study in an IoT system with one desktop computer,
one laptop and two Raspberry Pi single-board computers, where the ACCs, JC and RC are implemented based on the Ethereum
smart contract platform to achieve the access control.},

  abstract  = {Blockchain can potentially be deployed in a wide range of applications due to its capability to
ensure decentralization, transparency, and immutability. In this paper, we design a cryptographic membership
authentication scheme (i.e., authenticating graph data) to support blockchain-based identity management
systems (BIMS). Such a system is designed to bind a digital identity object to its real-world entity.
Specifically, we introduce a new transitively closed undirected graph authentication (TCUGA) scheme,
which only needs to use node signatures (e.g., certificates for identifying nodes). The trapdoor hash function
used in our scheme allows the signer to efficiently update the certificates without the need to re-sign the
nodes. In other words, our scheme is efficient even though the graph dynamically adds or deletes vertices
and edges. Moreover, our proposal can efficiently provide a proof when the edge between two vertices does
not exist, thus solving the existing intractability issue in transitive signature (the main tool for authenticating
graph data). Finally, we prove the security of our proposed TCUGA in the standard model and evaluate its
performance to show its feasibility for BIMS.},

a major challenge, mainly due to the massive scale and

provide decentralized security and privacy, yet they involve
significant energy, delay, and computational overhead that is
not suitable for most resource-constrained IoT devices. In our
previous work, we presented a lightweight instantiation of a
BC particularly geared for use in IoT by eliminating the Proof
of Work (POW) and the concept of coins. Our approach was
exemplified in a smart home setting and consists of three main
tiers namely: cloud storage, overlay, and smart home. In this
paper we delve deeper and outline the various core components
and functions of the smart home tier. Each smart home is
equipped with an always online, high resource device, known
as ”miner” that is responsible for handling all communication
within and external to the home. The miner also preserves
a private and secure BC, used for controlling and auditing
communications. We show that our proposed BC-based smart
home framework is secure by thoroughly analysing its security
with respect to the fundamental security goals of confidentiality,
integrity, and availability. Finally, we present simulation results
to highlight that the overheads (in terms of traffic, processing
time and energy consumption) introduced by our approach are
insignificant relative to its security and privacy gains.�},

it still suffers from privacy and security vulnerabilities. Conventional security and privacy
approaches tend to be inapplicable for IoT, mainly due to its decentralized topology and the
resource-constraints of the majority of its devices. BlockChain (BC) that underpin the cryptocurrency
Bitcoin have been recently used to provide security and privacy in peer-to-peer
networks with similar topologies to IoT. However, BCs are computationally expensive and
involve high bandwidth overhead and delays, which are not suitable for IoT devices. This
position paper proposes a new secure, private, and lightweight architecture for IoT, based on
BC technology that eliminates the overhead of BC while maintaining most of its security and
privacy benefits. The described method is investigated on a smart home application as a
representative case study for broader IoT applications. The proposed architecture is
hierarchical, and consists of smart homes, an overlay network and cloud storages
coordinating data transactions with BC to provide privacy and security. Our design uses
different types of BC’s depending on where in the network hierarchy a transaction occurs,
and uses distributed trust methods to ensure a decentralized topology. Qualitative evaluation
of the architecture under common threat models highlights its effectiveness in providing

  abstract   = {While the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been widely recognized as the essential
part of Smart Cities, it also brings new challenges in terms of privacy and security. Access control
(AC) is among the top security concerns, which is critical in resource and information protection
over IoT devices. Traditional access control approaches, like Access Control Lists (ACL), Role-based
Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC), are not able to provide a scalable,
manageable and efficient mechanism to meet the requirements of IoT systems. Another weakness
in today’s AC is the centralized authorization server, which can be the performance bottleneck
or the single point of failure. Inspired by the smart contract on top of a blockchain protocol, this
paper proposes BlendCAC, which is a decentralized, federated capability-based AC mechanism
to enable an effective protection for devices, services and information in large scale IoT systems.
A federated capability-based delegation model (FCDM) is introduced to support hierarchical and
multi-hop delegation. The mechanism for delegate authorization and revocation is explored. A robust
identity-based capability token management strategy is proposed, which takes advantage of the smart
contract for registering, propagating and revocating of the access authorization. A proof-of-concept
prototype has been implemented on both resources-constrained devices (i.e., Raspberry PI node) and
more powerful computing devices (i.e., laptops), and tested on a local private blockchain network.
The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the BlendCAC to offer a decentralized, scalable,
lightweight and fine-grained AC solution for IoT systems.},

and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger
projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org).
Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running
distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols,
which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and
trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs
distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming
languages, without systemic dependency on a native
cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing blockchain
platforms that require “smart-contracts” to be written in
domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes
the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership,
which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management.
To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel
blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with nondeterminism,
resource exhaustion, and performance attacks.
This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind
various design decisions, its most prominent implementation
aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model.
We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking
a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves
end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second
in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second
latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.},

by using randomizable technique, and a fuzzy attribute positioning mechanism

locate their attributes efficiently and decrypt the ciphertext successfully. Security

Cumulative Keyed-hash chain mechanism is introduced as a way to ensure the identity of the sender (through challenge-response).

The quality of our daily lives is improved by the IoT through pervasive computation and communication. Innumerable devices are being connected each day to IoT applications. Although the quality of our lives is enhanced by the IoT, IoT applications also cause serious challenges in securing networks and data in transit. Existing security solutions, such as password-based two-factor authentication and traditional biometric template-based authentication, can be challenged because of several threats that affect the reliability and efficiency of the entire system. Hence, there is a need for a highly secure authentication mechanism such as the Cancelable Biometric System (CBS). In essence, the CBS is a biometric template protection scheme that operates based on repeated distortions/transformations at the feature/signal level. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework for a cloud-based lightweight cancelable biometric authentication system. Findings from our study are used to demonstrate the potential for the proposed approach to be deployed in real-world settings (i.e., the capability to authenticate client devices with high accuracy and minimal overhead without affecting the security of the sensitive biometric templates in the cloud environment). Both theoretical and experimental analyses suggest that the proposed approach has a minimal equal error rate compared with those of the state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, the proposed approach has been proven to consume less time, making it suitable for IoT environments.},

smart things connecting to the Internet, terminals are vulnerable to various attacks. Thus the security
of IoT becomes important before they are widely applied. Smart home, as an interesting application of
IoT, has attracted more and more attention. However, most of the existing works have focused on the
authentication between devices and the home gateway, which are only able to realize coarse-grained
access control. In another word, once a device is authenticated, the user can access all the functions
of the device. This leads to the over-privilege access behavior. To solve this problem, we propose a
Function-based Access Control scheme in IoT (IoT-FBAC), that uses an Identity-based Encryption (IBE)
scheme. The proposed scheme provides fine-grained access control, prevents applications from accessing
unauthorized functions. Meanwhile, the cost of each access operation is a constant in IoT-FBAC scheme.
The security analysis indicates that the IoT-FBAC scheme is secure, which can prevent over-privilege
access. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective.�},

  abstract  = {With the advent of smart homes, smart cities, and smart everything, the Internet of Things (IoT) has
emerged as an area of incredible impact, potential, and growth, with Cisco Inc. predicting to have 50
billion connected devices by 2020. However, most of these IoT devices are easy to hack and compromise.
Typically, these IoT devices are limited in compute, storage, and network capacity, and therefore they are
more vulnerable to attacks than other endpoint devices such as smartphones, tablets, or computers.
In this paper, we present and survey major security issues for IoT. We review and categorize popular
security issues with regard to the IoT layered architecture, in addition to protocols used for networking,
communication, and management. We outline security requirements for IoT along with the existing
attacks, threats, and state-of-the-art solutions. Furthermore, we tabulate and map IoT security problems
against existing solutions found in the literature. More importantly, we discuss, how blockchain, which
is the underlying technology for bitcoin, can be a key enabler to solve many IoT security problems. The
paper also identifies open research problems and challenges for IoT security.

  abstract  = {Billions number of devices and everyday objects connected to the internet are
nowadays disrupting technology and changing the way we live. This paradigm,
also known as Internet of Things (IoT), faces significant threats related to security
and privacy. In this direction, we investigate a new way to build a distributed
access control framework that meets the new IoT security and privacy requirements
while the usual centralized way of designing access control systems are
not well designed for enforcing privacy policies. In this thesis, we show how
blockchain, the promising technology behind Bitcoin, can be very attractive to
face those arising challenges and enables building a new generation of decentralized
and transparent access control solutions that grants a more active role to IoT
end-users.
We introduce FairAccess as a novel Distributed Privacy Preserving Access Control
framework in IoT scenario that combines, for the first time, access control
models and cryptocurrency blockchain mechanisms. In FairAccess, we propose
the use of SmartContract to express fine-grained access control policies to
make authorization decisions. We opt for authorization tokens as access control
mechanism, delivered through emergent cryptocurrency solutions. We use
the blockchain firstly to ensure evaluating access policies in distributed environments
where there is no central authority/administrator, and guarantee that
policies will be properly enforced by all interacting entities and secondly to ensure
token reuse detection.
The public aspect of the blockchain ledger might initially appear to be at odds
with the private aspect of some access control policies. To tackle this issue, this
position thesis proposes a privacy-preserving distributed access control (PPDAC)
scheme to be integrated with FairAccess. PPDAC uses a white box version of Distributed
Cipher-text Policy Attribute Based Encryption “DCP-ABE” technique to
add a privacy layer hiding sensitive attributes and private access control policies
in the public blockchain while keeping the verification process transparent. In
addition, the use of recent protocol in cryptography such as zero proof of knowledge
“zk-SNARK” enables our framework to guarantee high anonymity and intractability
to IoT end users. The efficiency of the proposed PPDAC scheme has
been proved. Moreover, FairAccess has been investigated on a smart home application
as a representative case study for broader IoT applications. A real implementation
of the framework with a Raspberry pi device highlights its effectiveness
in providing security and privacy for IoT devices.},
